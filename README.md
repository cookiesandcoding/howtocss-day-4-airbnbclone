# html-css-day4-airbnb-clone

For the CSS workshop, I developed a clone of the Airbnb homepage with a primary focus on learning and applying CSS techniques. 🌟🏠 The project features a visually appealing and responsive design that closely resembles the Airbnb homepage layout, including key elements such as the search bar, featured properties, and navigation menu. 🔍✨ By replicating the homepage, the workshop aimed to provide hands-on experience with CSS properties and best practices, such as Flexbox, Grid, and media queries. 📐🎨 The clone showcases how to style various components, manage layout alignment, and ensure cross-browser compatibility. 🌐💻 This exercise allowed participants to grasp essential CSS concepts while creating a polished, real-world web page example. 🚀🔧
